# 🍄 Mushroom Classification Using Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying mushrooms as **edible or poisonous** using the **Random Forest** algorithm. The dataset contains various features that describe different properties of mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, odor, and more. 

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task is sourced from [Kaggle's Mushroom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification). It includes categorical features describing different mushroom characteristics.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Cap Shape, Cap Color, Odor** – Visual and scent properties.
- **Gill Attachment, Gill Spacing, Gill Color** – Details about the mushroom gills.
- **Stalk Shape, Stalk Surface, Stalk Color** – Characteristics of the stalk.
- **Habitat, Population** – Environmental factors.


## 🚀 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Project09_Mushroom_Classification_Using_Random_Forest.ipynb`.
2. Run each cell to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
3. The final output will show the model accuracy and feature importance.

## 📈 Results
- The **Random Forest** model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (update with actual results).
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: The most significant features in classification are odor, spore print color, and gill size.
- **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report**: Provides insight into model performance.
